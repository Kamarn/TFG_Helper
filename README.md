## Required Resource Pack for Anvil Calculator

### ⚠️ Important Notice

To correctly use the **Anvil Helper**, a **resource pack is required**.

The anvil calculator depends on the **red arrow indicator** shown in the anvil UI.  
Vanilla textures do not expose this arrow position as a readable numeric value.

### Required Resource Pack
**TFC Anvil Helper – Resource Pack**  
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/tfc-anvil-helper

This resource pack modifies the anvil interface so the red arrow position can be interpreted numerically by the user.

**Without this resource pack:**
- The Anvil Helper will still load
- Calculations will be inaccurate or unusable
- Arrow position cannot be reliably determined
